In C programming, scanf("%s", ...) and gets() are both used to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard), but they behave differently in several key ways:

1. Input Handling
scanf("%s", ...):

Reads a string until it encounters whitespace (space, tab, newline).
Stops reading when it encounters a space, so it cannot read strings with spaces.
Requires a buffer (character array) to store the input
and the buffer size should be large enough to hold the input string.

Usage example:
char str[100];
scanf("%s", str);


gets():

Reads an entire line of text until it encounters a newline character.
It can read strings with spaces because it continues reading until the newline.
Stores the input string, including spaces, but not the newline character.
Usage example:

char str[100];
gets(str);
